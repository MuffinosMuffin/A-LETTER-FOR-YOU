                    Hey! It’s been forever, haha. I Wanna say so much but I will try to keep it a small letter. First thing first Happy birthday Shef. So just to start off damn, that was hard (that hurt). How have you been? I know it’s redundant to ask because I know you well enough to guess the answer.
                </p>
                <p class="justified-text">
                    You know, it’s funny because there was a time when it crushed me to realize that you had found a love that ours could never be. (I honestly had a panic attack when I got that call.) Remember when I said, “Even if you fall in love with someone else, I’d be happy that at least you found love”? I promised that no matter how much it hurt, I would survive, I would thrive, and regardless of what happened moving forward, I would live my best life. That promise has been kept (though with many struggles along the way).
                </p>
                <p class="justified-text">
                    I really am thriving, but I still miss you sometimes. In fact, all the time. The thought just passes by, like a fleeting reminder of a love that was never meant to be.
                </p>
                <p class="justified-text">
                    It’s funny—I used to think you were my soulmate. But now, I realize you were more like my soul rival. You completed me—past tense. The universe never intended for us to have a lasting place in each other’s lives, yet I had to meet you to find myself. You were the lesson I never wanted but absolutely needed. I guess we both were. You had to lose me to love someone else, and I had to lose you to love myself. What a crazy price we had to pay, right?
                </p>
                <p class="justified-text">
                    And I’m still learning to love myself.
                </p>
                <p class="justified-text">
                    So yeah, you "completed" me in a way I never expected. Before meeting you, I hadn’t met anyone as competitive as me. With you, I had only two choices—either lose or let us both win (because I know you don’t lose). But you know me too well—I wasn’t going to lose either. So, I chose for both of us to win. That was the lesson in this love—it was a love I could never outmatch.
                </p>
                <p class="justified-text">
                    When I told you “I love you more,” I didn’t know I was actually talking about the heartbreak I would face, the need I had to be with you, or the darkest parts of myself. It seems almost foolish now, how hard I tried to force a love that was simply not meant to be. (Sorry, I was kind of delusional. You were right… as usual.) Now, I see it so clearly—you were meant to be with him. It almost feels ridiculous that I ever imagined a life different from the one right in front of me. It just makes sense now. We are happy. And you were never my love; I just wasn’t the right one for you.
                </p>
                <p class="justified-text">
                    You didn’t choose someone else over me—you chose your person.
                </p>
                <p class="justified-text">
                    In a world where it’s so hard to find real love, at the very least, I am truly glad that you did. You were never my sad ending—you were just not my ending.
                </p>
                <p class="justified-text">
                    Don’t get me wrong, though. I’m grateful I got to be a part of your story, even if it wasn’t meant to be a lasting one. And for the record, I’m glad you were a part of mine too. There’s something so poetic about how we met and how we ended. It all makes sense now, and I am genuinely thankful for where we are.
                </p>
                <p class="justified-text">
                    Do I have any regrets? Yeah, for sure. That time you made me sit through that seven-minute phone call—worst thing ever. (You know which one I’m talking about.) That will always be my biggest regret.
                </p>
                <p class="justified-text">
                    All jokes aside, though, even though we ended, even though things turned out the way they did, I don’t regret it. I’ve come to understand that neither of us could have done anything to change what was meant to happen. Looking at where we both are now, it seems almost pointless to have ever imagined a different outcome. It was real, it was beautiful, and it was complete while it lasted. A story to be remembered for a lifetime.
                </p>
                <p class="justified-text">
                    So one day, when you step into the sacred bond of marriage, into the love story that was always meant to be yours, I hope you remember that I am truly happy for you.
                </p>
                <p class="justified-text">
                    After all, how could I claim to believe in love if I couldn't wholeheartedly support it in someone I once loved so deeply?
                </p>
                <p class="justified-text">
                    We’ve grown so far apart now that we just don’t make sense together anymore. If I’m being honest, I don’t think we ever really did. There was a time when I would have rewritten the stars just to find my way back to you. But now, I wouldn’t change a thing. Not because you’re not worth it, or because I deserve better (you’re amazing), but because I know now that you are not the one I am meant to find.
                </p>
                <p class="justified-text">
                    People always misunderstand this line, but I know you’ll get it—I won’t find someone better than you; I’ll find someone better for me
                </p>
                <p class="justified-text">
                    I am so glad everything turned out the way it did. Nothing you could have done would have changed how things turned out, and neither could I. I know you gave it your all, and I will never think otherwise
                </p>
                <p class="justified-text">
                    With all of that being said, I finally understand everything you said back then. Everything you felt.
                </p>
                <p class="justified-text">
                    I used to say our time together was short, but now I realize it wasn’t. I think the moments we shared were infinite because I always loved you as if each day was my last. I never held anything back. From my perspective, I got to love you for a lifetime, and that will always be enough.
                </p>
                <p class="justified-text">
                    You will always be more than enough
                </p>
                <p class="justified-text">
                    That’s why I always say—I’m just so glad you exist.
                </p>
                <p class="justified-text">
                    Because at this point, that’s all I can really ask for. That you keep existing. That you’re out there, somewhere, living your life.
                </p>
                <p class="justified-text">
                    Words can’t quite capture it, but when I say it’s just you—that’s all I mean. That’s all I’ll ever need to say.
                </p>
                <p class="justified-text">
                    You are living proof that love is never wasted.
                </p>
                <p class="justified-text">
                    And now, I say goodbye with a complete heart. I say goodbye with a smile on my face. I say goodbye with love in my heart.
                </p>
                <p class="justified-text">
                    <strong>Genuinely, with love—Goodbye.</strong>
                </p>
                <p> <strong>AND KEEP IT A SECRET</strong>
